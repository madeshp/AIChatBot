The current BART UI relies heavily on Expero’s proprietary framework, which restricts customization, scalability, and long-term support. Many components are tightly coupled to vendor-specific code, making enhancements slow, costly, and difficult to maintain. The existing stack is outdated and misaligned with modern React best practices, limiting performance and developer productivity. Migrating to a modern React-based UI gives full control over the user experience, improves maintainability, and enables rapid feature development. It also allows adoption of advanced libraries like Cytoscape, MSAL, React Query, and TanStack Table for better performance and richer capabilities. Additionally, migration ensures seamless Azure SSO integration, stronger security, and eliminates vendor lock-in, reducing both future risks and operational costs.


1. Target Future Architecture
🏗 Frontend:

React 18+

TypeScript

Vite or Next.js 14 (recommended for SSO + Routing)

State Management: Redux Toolkit OR Recoil/Zustand

UI Library: MUI / Chakra UI OR TailwindCSS+ShadCN

Graph Visualization: Cytoscape.js (open-source, no Expero dependency)

🔌 Backend:

Not part of this question — assumed unchanged. Backend only exposes:

TigerGraph REST endpoints

Authentication (Azure OAuth)

Notification/Queue endpoints

2. Modules You Need to Rebuild

From your description, you need to migrate 8 modules:

A. Top Navigation

User menu

Display user details

Show “User Management” only for admin role

Permissions panel (RBAC)

B. Search Explorer

Graph Explorer

Search bar for vertex IDs

Render TigerGraph nodes/edges using Cytoscape.js

Expand neighbors like TigerGraph GraphStudio

Node Details Drawer

C. Queues

Alerts Queue

Cases Queue

Hotlists Queue

Ring Queue

Paginated list

Filters

Status badges

Drilldown details screen

D. Authentication

Azure OAuth SSO (MSAL)

E. Entities and Ring Pages

PEA Entity / PEE Entity / Ring Details

Tabular format

Sub-panels (addresses, accounts, devices etc.)

Audit trail

3. Migration Plan — Phase by Phase
Phase 1: Discovery & Architecture

✔ Review current Expero components
✔ Identify custom logic (TigerGraph queries, expansions)
✔ Prepare API contract layer (REST wrapper)
✔ Plan data models (TypeScript interfaces)

OUTPUT: Architecture document + UI wireframes

Phase 2: Setup New Project

Choose Vite + React + TS or Next.js.

Install base packages:

npm create vite@latest bart-ui --template react-ts


Core libraries to install:

npm install axios redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-router-dom
npm install tailwindcss @tanstack/react-table
npm install cytoscape cytoscape-dagre
npm install @azure/msal-browser @azure/msal-react

Phase 3: Authentication Implementation

Use Azure MSAL to enforce SSO.

Packages:

@azure/msal-browser

@azure/msal-react

Features:

✔ Login redirect
✔ Access Token retrieval
✔ Admin role detection
✔ Token injection in API calls

Phase 4: Graph Explorer Migration

Rebuild graph visualization using pure Cytoscape.js.

Packages:

cytoscape

cytoscape-dagre (layout)

cytoscape-popper (tooltips)

cytoscape-expand-collapse (optional)

Features:

✔ Load Vertex by ID
✔ Expand neighbors
✔ Node-style mapping (type → color)
✔ Node click → side drawer

Phase 5: Queues Migration

Each queue becomes its own reusable table page.

Packages:

@tanstack/react-table (BEST modern table)

swr or react-query for data fetching

date-fns for formatting

Features:

✔ Pagination
✔ Filters
✔ Column sorting
✔ Row details page

Phase 6: Entity & Ring Details Pages

Build structured data grids.

Packages:

@tanstack/react-table

react-json-view-lite (optional for JSON display)

Features:
✔ Summary panel
✔ Related PE entities
✔ Accounts / Devices / Addresses
✔ Risk score components
