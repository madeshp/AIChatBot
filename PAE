TigerGraph Documentation – Managing Stale or Duplicate PAEEntity Vertices
1. Background

In the data model, PAEEntity vertices represent a specific type of entity that can connect to multiple PEEntity vertices.
Over time, due to entity shifts, ID changes, or data re-ingestion, multiple PAEEntity vertices may end up representing the same real-world entity.

Symptoms of this problem:

Duplicate PAEEntity nodes pointing to the same set of PEEntity nodes

Old PAEEntity nodes becoming stale when a fresh version is inserted

Analyst confusion because multiple versions appear in the graph explorer

Wrong results in fraud detection or Louvain community clustering due to duplications

To solve this, the system needs a way to:

Identify when a PAEEntity was last updated

Compare two or more PAEEntity nodes associated with the same PEEntity

Keep the most recent one

Delete older or stale versions

2. Introducing a New Attribute: LastUpdatedDateTime
Purpose of the Attribute

Store the exact timestamp when the PAEEntity was last refreshed or created.

Allow the system to easily determine the latest version of an entity.

Enable automatic cleanup jobs to identify stale/duplicate nodes.

Improve downstream analytics and ensure a clean cluster structure.

Where It Will Be Added

The attribute will be added directly to the PAEEntity vertex type.

It becomes part of the standard metadata for every PAEEntity node.

What It Represents

If the vertex already existed, the timestamp indicates when it was last synchronized.

If the vertex was newly created during data load, the timestamp marks its creation moment.

3. Pre-Data-Load Activity: Updating Last Updated Timestamp

Before ingesting the new batch of data, all existing PAEEntity vertices must have their LastUpdatedDateTime refreshed.

Why This Is Important

Ensures consistent baseline timestamps across existing PAEEntities.

Helps the system determine which entities are “older” vs. “newly inserted” after the load.

Prevents accidental deletion of legitimate nodes during the cleanup process.

Outcome of Pre-Load Update

All PAEEntity vertices will have a fresh timestamp.

Any newly created PAEEntity added during the data load will naturally have a newer timestamp.

This prepares the graph for the cleanup logic that follows.

4. Data Load Phase

When the batch/stream load runs:

New PAEEntity vertices may be inserted.

Existing ones may be linked to additional PEEntity nodes.

Some new PAEEntity vertices may represent the same real-world object as older ones.

After the load completes:

The graph may contain clusters of PAEEntity vertices referencing the same set of PEEntity connections.

Only one version should remain—the most recently updated one.

5. Post-Data-Load Cleanup Job: DeleteStaleEntity

The cleanup process is designed to detect stale or duplicate PAEEntity vertices and remove them.

5.1. Goal of DeleteStaleEntity

Ensure that for any given set of PEEntity connections, only one PAEEntity vertex is retained.

Always keep the one with the latest LastUpdatedDateTime.

Remove all older versions that refer to the same underlying entity.

5.2. How the Cleanup Logic Works
Step 1: Identify Related PAEEntities

For each PEEntity, find all PAEEntity vertices connected to it.

Group PAEEntity vertices that share the same set of connected PEEntity nodes.

Step 2: Determine the "Latest" PAEEntity

For each group of duplicates:

Compare their LastUpdatedDateTime values.

Identify the PAEEntity vertex with the most recent timestamp.

Mark it as the primary or retained entity.

Step 3: Mark Stale Entities for Deletion

All PAEEntity vertices in the group except the primary one are marked as stale.

This includes:

Outdated versions

Incorrectly ingested duplicates

Entities that still have relationships but represent older data

Step 4: Delete Stale PAEEntity Vertices

All marked stale entities are removed from the graph.

Their redundant edges are also removed.

The PEEntity nodes will now link only to the latest valid PAEEntity.

6. Benefits of This Approach
Eliminates Duplicate Noise

Only one authoritative PAEEntity remains for each real-world entity, reducing confusion.

Ensures High-Quality Relationships

PEEntity nodes will no longer show multiple parent PAEEntities representing the same source.

Improves Fraud & Risk Analytics

Cleaner entity clusters improve Louvain results, graph traversal clarity, and detection accuracy.

Prevents Long-Term Data Drift

The timestamp-based method guarantees that stale or incorrect versions get automatically cleaned over time.

7. Operational Workflow Summary
Before Every Data Load

Refresh LastUpdatedDateTime for all PAEEntity vertices.

During Data Load

Insert new PAEEntity nodes with fresh timestamps.

After Data Load

Run DeleteStaleEntity job:

Identify duplicates based on PEEntity connections

Compare LastUpdatedDateTime

Keep only the latest PAEEntity

Delete stale ones
